A complete implementation of the Join-Accumulate Machine (JAM) protocol for Polkadot, written in Rust.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview

This project implements the JAM (Join-Accumulate Machine) protocol as specified in the [Gray Paper](https://graypaper.com/graypaper.pdf) by Dr. Gavin Wood. JAM is the proposed next-generation protocol to replace Polkadot's Relay Chain, combining Ethereum-style smart contracts with Polkadot-style rollup computation.
